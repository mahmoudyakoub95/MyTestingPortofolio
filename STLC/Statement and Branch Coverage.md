## . Statement Coverage

Using our counting method, we count executable instructions and exclude if and elif.

There are 7 statements in total:

- 5 print statements
- 2 return statements

The last print statement (”additional statement 5”), is unreachable because it comes after return True.

The tests cover the other 6 statements.

Statement coverage = (6 / 7) × 100 = 85.71%

### Without the unreachable statement

After removing the unreachable statement, 6 statements remain, and all 6 are covered.

Statement coverage = (6 / 6) × 100 = 100%

## 2. Branch Coverage

There are 3 decisions, each with 2 possible outcomes (True or False).

Total branches = 3 × 2 = 6

The test cases cover both outcomes of all three decisions.

Branch coverage = (6 / 6) × 100 = 100%

### Without the unreachable statement

Removing the unreachable print statement does not affect the decisions or branches.

Branch coverage = (6 / 6) × 100 = 100%

## Final Results

| Coverage type | Original code | Without unreachable statement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Statement coverage | 85.71% | 100% |
| Branch coverage | 100% | 100% |
